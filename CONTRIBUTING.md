## I Have a Question
> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/KPAOSsc/kpaos-info-sys/wiki).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Q&A Discussions](https://github.com/KPAOSsc/kpaos-info-sys/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=) that might help you.
In case you have found a suitable discussion and still need clarification, you can write your question in that discussion.
It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.
